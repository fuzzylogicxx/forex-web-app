# FreeAgent Front End Coding Challenge: Foreign Exchange Rates
An interactive web interface for comparing Foreign Exchange rates. 

The app meets meets all of the challenge requirements which were as follows:
- Provides a form to accept the user’s chosen base EUR value 
- Using the ​http://fixer.io​ API, gets today’s latest exchange rates, and shows converted values in USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY, SEK, and NZD.
- Changing the base currency (EUR) amount re-calculates the exchange amounts for the listed currencies.
- Currency rows are selectable. On selection of two rows, the app renders a table with the exchange rates of the selected currencies over the last 5 days period.
- Uses both Ruby and JavaScript in a layered approach.
- Uses minimal CSS with no reliance on frameworks.

## See it in action
You can clone this repo then run it locally, however I also wanted to provide a hosted demo as a convenience. I chose Heroku as host having found that it is well suited for apps which combine a mix of Rails and Node.

See the app at [https://hughes-forex.herokuapp.com/](https://hughes-forex.herokuapp.com/)
